## Overview

Scrume ("we", "our", or "the app") is a Scrum project management application for iOS. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our app.

**The short version: We don't collect any data. Everything stays on your device.**

- ❌ Account credentials (no account required)
- ❌ Location data
- ❌ Device identifiers
- ❌ Usage analytics or statistics

## Data Storage & Security

### Local Storage Only

Scrume operates in a **completely offline mode**. Your data is:

- Stored locally in the app's sandboxed container
- Never uploaded to any server
- Never shared with third parties
- Never accessible by us or anyone else

### Encryption

Your data is protected with industry-standard security:

- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: All data is encrypted at rest using Advanced Encryption Standard with 256-bit keys in Galois/Counter Mode
- **iOS Keychain**: Encryption keys are stored securely in the iOS Keychain, protected by the device's Secure Enclave (on supported devices)
- **Complete File Protection**: Data files use iOS Complete File Protection, making them inaccessible when the device is locked

## Third-Party Services

Scrume does **NOT** integrate with any third-party services:

- ❌ No analytics (Google Analytics, Firebase, etc.)
- ❌ No advertising networks
- ❌ No social media SDKs
- ❌ No crash reporting services
- ❌ No cloud storage services

---

## Internet Connection

Scrume does **NOT** require an internet connection to function. The app:

- Works completely offline
- Makes no network requests
- Does not communicate with any servers

---

## Data Sharing

We do **NOT** share your data with anyone because:

1. We don't have access to your data
2. Your data never leaves your device
3. There is no server-side component

---

## Data Retention

Your data remains on your device until you:

- Delete specific items within the app
- Use the "Clear All Data" feature in Settings
- Delete the app from your device

When you delete the app, all associated data is permanently removed from your device.

---

## Children's Privacy

Scrume does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13 years of age. The app is safe for users of all ages.

---

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any data, traditional data rights (access, correction, deletion, portability) are handled entirely by you through the app itself:

- **Access**: All your data is visible in the app
- **Correction**: Edit any data directly in the app
- **Deletion**: Delete individual items or all data via Settings
- **Portability**: Export feature available in Settings

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document.

Since Scrume does not collect any data, changes to this policy will generally be minor clarifications or updates to reflect new features.
